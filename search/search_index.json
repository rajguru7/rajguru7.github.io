I cleared  the Joint Entrance Examination with merit which allowed me to enroll in the Indian Institute of Technology shortlisting process. IIT Bombay being the cream on top of IITs and it being a three-hour drive from my home was one of the best options staring back at me. The only catch... due to my ranking (2124) I would not be able to get a direct entry into Computer Science. I decided to go ahead with IIT Bombay, thinking that I could switch to CS. I got Civil Engineering as per my merit and worked hard to get a CGPA of 8.77/10 at the end of my first year. This allowed me to get a merit-based department change but alas, I was only able to switch up to Chemical Engineering due to the hierarchy of streams with CS on top.</p> <p>To gain some experience in programming, I ventured into data analytics. I completed a few MOOCs and two internships. One internship was on Microarray and Mass Spectrometer data analysis and the other was on creating a fairer system of ranking for Triathletes by modelling the difficulty of triathlon races quantitatively. The latter project was a unique experience as I worked in the Faculty of Kinesiology and Physical Education at University of Toronto. After my Bachelor\u2019s I got a job at ICICI Bank as a Technology Manager. I dealt with cloud architecture, DevOps, project management and worked as a Kubernetes cluster administrator, setting up RBAC permissions, resource limits, monitoring and logging solutions for audit purposes. It fascinated me that the security team always has the final say in decisions regarding the architecture and the application. I realised that I wanted to understand more on the security aspects and do what it takes to earn that responsibility.</p> <p>To start my venture into Cybersecurity, I believe that having a strong technical background in Computer Science is essential. During the first year of my job at ICICI Bank, I read the complete text on Computer Networks (Tanenbaum) and Operating Systems (Silberschatz). I practiced coding and Data Structures and Algorithms problems, having solved 200+ problems on LeetCode. To get hands on experience, I decided to work on research projects. Under the guidance of Prof. Stjepan Picek of Delft University of Technology, I worked on investigating the effectiveness of neuron coverage fuzzing against backdoored CNN models and also applied critical neuron differential fuzzing to identify backdoored inputs. Another research project was under the guidance of Prof. Apostolis Zarras of Delft University of Technology. It involved building an automated tool that used fuzzing to detect vulnerable smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.</p> <p>As a next step I have decided to go for a Master\u2019s degree in Cybersecurity. I started by MS in Cybersecurity at NYU. Although I am doing my Master's degree which is providing me a thorough understanding of the basics, I believe that delving into CTFs and trying to earn a bug bounty will teach me a lot about security at deeper levels. So I have actively started participating in CTFs. Surprisingly, I have already earned two achievements. I qualified for the next (in-person) round for VIVID CTF and my team also earned the first spot among the in-person teams who had participated in Jersey CTF. </p>","tags":["IIT","decisions"]},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/creating-digitalfortressme/","title":"Creating digitalfortress.me","text":"<p>Creating a website has always been on my TODO list but I never got around to doing it. I was surfing the internet when I landed on https://0ut3r.space/.  I was immediately impressed by the design and simplicity of the website. Also, the content was more to my liking. I bookmarked the website and carried on with my life (procrastinating as usual). Around this time, there no new internship opportunities being offered and I knew that a personal website would come in handy when applying for jobs next year at the end of my masters. So, finally after playing a lot of league of legends and watching a lot of anime at the start of the break, I decided to finally get around to creating my website.</p>","tags":["mkdocs","cms"]},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/creating-digitalfortressme/#choosing-a-static-site-generator","title":"Choosing a static site generator","text":"<p>I had been using mkdocs for the past two years for my notes so it struck me that I could use the same for my website as well.

If offers many freebies. I had used offers on frontendmasters, 1password and GitHub pro. I remembered coming across an offer for a free domain from namecheap. It was offering a free '.me' domain for a year for students hosting on GitHub pages. Plus it automatically configured the SSL certificate for the domain. <code>mkdocs</code> has good documentation for deploying to GitHub pages and the material theme also provides a GitHub workflow yaml in its documentation for deploying to GitHub pages. So, GitHub pages it was.</p>","tags":["mkdocs","cms"]},{"location":"blog/2024/05/27/creating-digitalfortressme/#choosing-the-domain-name","title":"Choosing the domain name","text":"<p>I wanted a domain name that would reflect my interest in cybersecurity. Also, I like the idea of blue and red colliding because there are blue teams and red teams in cybersecurity as well. I came up with the name <code>digitalfortress.me</code>. Luckily it was available on namecheap as well. To make the logo I used ChatGPT 4 to generate a logo for me. Below was the final prompt after a few iterations:</p> <pre><code>Create an image of a logo depicting a blue digital fortress being attacked by a\ndark red sea, symbolizing a cyber attack. The fortress should have a futuristic,\ndigital appearance with circuit-like patterns and pixel textures. The dark red\nsea should look dynamic and aggressive. The entire image should have no\nbackground, focusing solely on the contrasting colors and elements of the blue\nfortress and the red sea attack.\n</code></pre> <p>Creating this website was a fun experience and I am happy with the result. For more technical details check out my notes on the website creation process here.
