## mkdocs-plugin-inline-svg-mod

A MkDocs plugin that allows you to embed SVG files directly into your Markdown content.

- modification of the original [mkdocs-plugin-inline-svg](https://gitlab.com/craig0990/mkdocs-plugin-inline-svg)
- adds support to delete content from SVG files
- helped me to remove extra content from `.excalidraw.svg` files to reduce size
  of images.
