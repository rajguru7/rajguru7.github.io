# Digital Fortress

> Hi, I am Saurabh. Welcome to Digital Fortress, my personal website.

Who I am?

I am currently studying Cybersecurity at NYU. I have a background in various
fields. I did my bachelor's in Chemical Engineering from IIT Bombay and worked
as a Technology Manager in a bank where I was responsible for the development
and deployment of a major remittance application. You can read more about my
journey [here](blog/posts/journey.md). Apart from technical aspects I am into calisthenics and
playing guitar.

What you'll find here?

A collection of my thoughts, projects, and experiences. The content will be
mostly geared towards cybersecurity, technology, and personal development.

Where else can you find me?
