# Thinking of safety in India

Please note that I am not a law student or a lawyer. Due to the recent events in
India I decided to start thinking about the safety of people in India. Full
disclosure, I have never looked into civil matters before. <!-- stop -->

## Some things to note

* There will always be threat actors in the system.
* No security system is perfect.
* Try to think collectively.
* Always go down to first principles.
* Keep it simple.

## Recent Problems:

1. Illegal recording

1. Rape  
    <https://x.com/BDUTT/status/1823020031493509520>

## What we need:

1.  Transparency

    > Surveillance & transparent law enforcement

1.  Awareness

    > Educate - so people do better things in life

1.  Liability

    > Have strict laws so that people are afraid of breaking them. Enforcement of
    the laws is also important.


## Illegal Recording

**Transparency**

The phone was kept in a restroom. There can't be any surveillance inside a
restroom.
Surveillance cameras should be capturing the area outside the restroom.

The investigation and legal proceedings should be open to scrutiny for the
people who are involved. I am not sure about what can be disclosed to the public
as it will depend on a case by case basis. Law folks please comment.

**Awareness**

People should be aware of the consequences of illegally recording someone.

**Liability**

The consequences of illegally recording someone should be severe enough to deter
people from doing it.


## Rape

**Transparency**

I've heard that a lot of cover up is being done.
Destroying evidence can be treated as another problem.
The evidence has to be preserved. If the police and authorities are corrupt then
we made a mistake in giving them the power to do so.

**Awareness**

Again, people should be aware of the consequences of raping someone.

**Liability**

The thought of raping someone should scare the shit out of people.

## Next Steps?

Finally, I believe that everyone needs to have a better standard of living to
improve life in general.

Since my primary focus is not dealing with social and civil matters, I will not
be working on this. If anyone wants to discuss or actually do something about
it, reach out to me on X. I'll try writing more and doing something based on the
number of people that think this is a good initiative.
